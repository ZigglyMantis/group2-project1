Most travel websites only give you prices on flights and hotels. When you want to plan for events or food, you have to rely on additional websites to help you navigate to the best activities or restaurants upon arrival at your vacation destination. Well, there is a solution for that with our website "A Getaway". 

Our website allows the user to search for the lowest price based on user's departure, arrival and date inputs. It will search for the trendiest, and top activities in the area so you don't have to do additional searching. It will also display the best restaurants in the area according to Yelp. You can even save your search so if you change you mind, you can still retrieve it.

Features:
1. Retrieve the lowest price for airline tickets based on user's departure, arrival and date inputs from Skyscanner API
2. Collect data from Yelp to display the best activities in the arrival city.
3. Collect data from Yelp to display the best restaurants in the arrival city.
4. Display review stars, address, links of the corresponding search
5. User can save the search to their favorite to retrieve later even after the page is refreshed.

A Getaway Website
Description: A Getaway is a travel website that allows us to be able to look up flight ticket at a low rate that also includes top recommendations at the city.

Motivation: We are following the concept of the customer-driven marketing strategy to build a travel site that suits our consumers. Not only will they be able to look up cheap flights, they will also be recommended the best the city has to offer. More importantly, they can save their favorite searches and retrieve them anytime.

Result: We were successfully able to combine a few API together to form a functioning website. All the functions and goals that were set at the beginning of the project have been met.

Team Efforts: As a team, we came to a decision on the idea of the project. Everyone contributes to the ideas of what could be done to improve the visual of the site. We all collaborated on individual functionality and/or styling of the site and collectively review and tested the website for any bugs. 

Individual Responsibilities:
Trai – Skyscanner / yelp api

Ziggy – front end css styling

Romit – airport code api

Pat – datepicker api

Challenges:
Skyscanner API takes a long time to load and occasionally give us status code 400’s when there are too many requests made. They limit the number of requests.
There are some API’s that do not have well written documentation so it was hard to style it. We had to play around with the styling using trial-and-error method to get the styling to workout (date picker API).

Improvements: 
The styling around the input field could be improved with more documentation from the source API’s (airport code and datepicker).
In the future, this site would benefit if we are able to allow users to create an account.
